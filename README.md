# ML-Projects
Backup of my ML code and projects
Had to wipe my old hard drive so this is the classic "backup" after the tragedy that made me need one :(

# Plans going forward:
- Convolutional Network class
- **Network Visualizer**
- Weight saving process (text file?)
- Modular activation functions and backpropagation methods
- Modular NLP
